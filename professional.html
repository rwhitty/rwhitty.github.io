            This semester, I am working as a tutor for Berkeley's upper-division algorithms course, 
            <a class="link" href="https://www.cs170.org/staff">CS 170</a>. 
            My responsibilities will include assisting students with assignments in office hours, writing/debugging 
            course content, and proctoring exams.<br><br>

            During summer 2023, I worked as a software engineer intern at 
            <a class="link" href="https://diagnostics.roche.com/us/en/home.html">Roche Diagnostics</a>. 
            I primarily worked on developing algorithms for data processing and validation in the gene sequencing 
            system, working with Python, Groovy, Bash, and Jenkins.<br><br>

            In the spring 2023 semester, I volunteered as an academic intern for Berkeley's introductory data 
            structures course, <a class="link" href="https://datastructur.es">CS 61B</a>. 
            I assisted students with programming projects and conceptual data structures knowledge in weekly labs.
            <br><br>

            During summer 2022, I worked as a data analyst intern at the 
            <a class="link" href="https://braininflammation.org/">Brain Inflammation Collaborative</a>, a startup 
            doing medical research. I helped develop a data pipeline from patient entry to visualization and analysis, 
            using Python (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy) and Google Data Studio.
            <br><br>

            Now, I am looking for internships in software engineering, machine learning, and data science for summer 2024. 
            Feel free to reach out with any opportunities! :)
